I'm a beginner in programming,this is my first project done with my friend.     

**The program is for Windows only.**  

To compile ,just open the cmd type make or mingw32-make and it will make a execution file.   

**Hint:Before you do this ,you should install compiler such as MinGw-w64 in your computer.**
